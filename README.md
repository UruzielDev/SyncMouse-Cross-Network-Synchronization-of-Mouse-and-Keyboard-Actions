Project Description:
SyncMouse is a client-server application that enables synchronization of mouse and keyboard actions between a main computer (server) and multiple client computers. With SyncMouse, users can control client computers remotely by simply performing actions on the main computer. The application facilitates cursor movement, left and right mouse clicks, and keyboard strokes, providing a seamless experience across different networks.

The server-side component runs on the main computer and acts as a central control point. Clients connect to the server using their network's IP address and receive instructions to mimic the mouse and keyboard actions performed on the server. The application supports both local network synchronization and synchronization across different networks, allowing users to control client computers from anywhere.

Key Features:

Cross-network synchronization of mouse movements, left and right clicks, and keyboard strokes.
Simple and intuitive GUI for the server and client applications.
Automatic IP address detection for easy setup.
Support for connecting to the server across different networks with port forwarding.
Clear instructions and guidance for users to configure their network settings.
Customizable and extensible for future enhancements and additional features.
With SyncMouse, users can streamline their workflow, control multiple computers effortlessly, and collaborate effectively in various scenarios such as presentations, remote assistance, or gaming sessions. The project's flexibility, simplicity, and robust functionality make it an ideal solution for remote control and synchronization of mouse and keyboard actions.
